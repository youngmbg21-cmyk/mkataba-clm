## Run: Ingestion, AI Budget & Templates upgrade

### 1. Word files were accepted, silently produced nothing, and landed as empty shells

**What was broken.** The file picker offered `.doc` and `.docx` in all three
ingestion entry points (single upload, bulk migration, template upload). But
`extractDocText()` only ever handled `text/*` and `pdf`. A Word file was
therefore accepted, produced an empty string, and a contract record was created
anyway — no counterparty, no dates, no text for the AI review, and an audit
entry that said the document had been imported. Silent failure, and the user
only found out later when the register showed a blank row.

**Root cause.** `MIG_ACCEPT` (`js/views/migration.js`), the `accept` attribute on
`#up-file` (`js/views/contract.js`) and on `#ut-file` (`js/views/library.js`) all
advertised Word support that the extraction path never had. Nothing checked the
file type before creating the record, and the template upload's failure message
told the user "Word files need conversion first" *after* extraction, which is
the right advice at the wrong time.

**The fix.**
- Added `detectWordBytes()` / `detectWordFile()` in `js/views/contract.js`,
  which sniffs the actual bytes rather than trusting the extension or the MIME
  type: `PK\x03\x04` plus a `word/…` OOXML part name means `.docx`;
  `D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1` (OLE2 compound file) means legacy `.doc`. The byte
  check is what catches drag-and-drop, which bypasses `accept` entirely, and a
  renamed file.
- Refusal happens **before** any contract record, file upload or audit entry is
  created, in all three entry points, with one shared message (`WORD_REFUSAL`):
  *"HaTi can't read Word files yet. Save or print the document as a PDF and
  upload that instead — the PDF is also what you'd want on record as the signed
  version."*
- The bulk migration queue shows a distinct `word` row status ("Word — not
  read"), not a generic `error`, and the batch summary counts refusals
  separately.
- Removed `.doc,.docx` from every `accept` attribute so the picker no longer
  invites the file in, and updated the surrounding copy in all three places.

**Files touched.** `js/views/contract.js`, `js/views/migration.js`,
`js/views/library.js`, `js/core.js` (new `EXTRACT_MAX_CHARS` export).

**How it was verified.** Byte-signature detection unit-checked against a
generated `.docx` (real ZIP with `word/document.xml`), a renamed `.docx`
(extension `.pdf`), a legacy OLE2 `.doc` header, and the five bundled
`sample-contracts/*.pdf` files (all correctly *not* flagged). Confirmed no
contract record, no `files` POST and no audit entry is produced on refusal.

### 2. AI spend was governed by request count, which never tracked the bill

**What was broken.** Three related problems.
(a) `aiDailyLimit` counted *activity*, not *cost* — a cheap metadata extraction
and an expensive playbook review each ticked the counter by one, so the ceiling
did not track the thing it exists to protect. (b) With a default of 500/day it
blocked onboarding: importing a 500-contract back catalogue is at least one call
per contract, so a new customer's most important task could not be finished in a
day. (c) The counter lived in the settings blob and was reset by anything that
lost it; a daily *money* budget cannot tolerate that.

**Root cause.** `recordAiCall()` incremented a bare integer inside
`anthropicMessages()` and ignored the `usage` block Anthropic already returns on
every response. There was no price table, no per-feature attribution, and no
concept of a separate onboarding budget.

**The fix.**
- **Meter money.** `recordAiSpend()` prices each call's `input_tokens`,
  `output_tokens` and cache tokens against an admin-editable per-model rate table
  (`aiRates`, seeded with pricing verified 2026-07-25; cache writes 1.25× and
  cache reads 0.1× of the input rate) and writes it to a new **`ai_spend` SQLite
  table** keyed by day and feature. It survives a restart; the request count is
  now derived from the same ledger.
- **New primary ceiling `aiDailySpendLimit`** (USD, admin-editable, env fallback
  `AI_DAILY_SPEND_LIMIT`, default 10). `aiDailyLimit` is retained as a blunt
  secondary guard with its default raised 500 → 5000, and the UI states plainly
  that spend is the real control.
- **Spend is shown as money**, broken down by feature — "Today: $2.14 of $10.00
  · 142 requests" plus a per-feature table (extraction, OCR, clause review,
  obligations, portfolio graph, search, template advisor, Copilot).
- **Onboarding allowance.** A one-off budget in money and/or documents that bulk
  migration and OCR draw on instead of the daily ceiling, opened from Team &
  Settings, burning down visibly on the Migration screen. When it runs out the
  server answers 429 with `allowanceExhausted` and migration continues on the
  pattern matcher with a clear message rather than hard-failing mid-batch.
- **Pre-flight estimate** on the Migration screen ("25 documents, about 180
  pages, estimated $1.20"), with explicit confirmation above an admin-set
  threshold. Labelled as an estimate throughout.
- **OCR counts as one request per document**, not one per page; pages count
  toward spend and `ocrMaxPages`.
- The 15-minute per-user limiters (`aiRateLight` 40 / `aiRateDeep` 15) are
  untouched. The `429` + `Retry-After` shape is preserved; a distinct, equally
  friendly message covers the spend ceiling, because the remedy is different.

**Files touched.** `server/server.js`, `js/views/settings.js`,
`js/views/migration.js`, `js/metadata.js`, `js/api.js`, `js/core.js`,
`README.md`.

**How it was verified.** Ran the server against a scratch database: seeded a
ledger day, confirmed `/api/ai/spend` reports `$3.64 · 151 requests` split
across two features; lowered `dailySpendLimit` below it and confirmed
`/api/ai/extract` returns 429 with the spend-ceiling message and
`spendLimit: true`; exhausted an allowance and confirmed the
`allowanceExhausted` 429; restarted the process and confirmed both spend and
allowance survived. Rate-table edit, reset-to-defaults and rejection of a
negative rate all confirmed over HTTP.

### 3. Scanned paper was a dead end — the product handed the customer's problem back

**What was broken.** `extractDocText()` returned text only for true digital PDFs
and plain text. A scanned contract or a phone photo yielded nothing: the
migration flagged it `blocked: 'no-text'`, the register row came back empty, and
the customer typed the whole agreement by hand. The target customer is a Nairobi
business with drawers of scanned paper, so this was the single largest hole in
the ingestion story.

**Root cause.** There was no rasterization and no recogniser — only the two
existing PDF text-layer extractors. `blocked: 'no-text'` was also set *before*
anything had tried to read the image, so the gate fired on documents that were
perfectly readable, just not as a text layer.

**The fix.** New `js/ocr.js` plus a new `POST /api/ai/ocr` endpoint (see
`DESIGN-ocr.md` for the full design note).
- **Detect**: a PDF under 200 characters of text layer is image-only; images go
  straight to OCR.
- **Rasterize**: pdf.js, loaded lazily as an ES module, renders each page to a
  canvas at ~200 DPI, exported as JPEG q0.72.
- **Recognise, two tiers**: Claude vision via the server proxy (`ocr-ai`) with a
  strict transcribe-don't-summarise prompt that marks unreadable words
  `[illegible]`; Tesseract.js in-browser (`ocr-local`) when there is no key or in
  static mode, labelled as the slower, less accurate fallback. A hard failure
  mid-document falls back to the local tier rather than abandoning the document.
- **Limits**: `ocrMaxPages` (30) and `aiRateOcr`, both admin-editable with env
  fallbacks. Over the page cap the first N pages are read, saved, and the skipped
  pages are named — never a refusal.
- **Progress**: a live page counter in the upload strip ("Reading page 4 of 12")
  and in the migration queue row; the batch stays cancellable mid-document and
  keeps the pages already read.
- **Honesty**: `upload.textSource` / `ocrPages` / `ocrSkippedPages` recorded;
  `capConfidenceForOcr()` caps every OCR-derived field at medium until a human
  confirms it; audit trail, document viewer, review panel and clause review all
  state the text was machine-read from a scan; `blocked: 'no-text'` can now only
  fire after OCR has been attempted and failed.
- The CSP gains two named CDN origins and `worker-src blob:`; all three library
  URLs are overridable via `window.HATI_OCR_*` for egress-restricted deployments.

**Files touched.** `js/ocr.js` (new), `server/server.js`, `js/views/contract.js`,
`js/views/migration.js`, `js/views/library.js`, `js/metadata.js`, `js/app.js`,
`sample-contracts/06_Scanned_Test_Document.pdf` (new fixture), `README.md`,
`DESIGN-ocr.md`.

**How it was verified.** Driven end to end in real Chromium against the committed
fixture (`06_Scanned_Test_Document.pdf`, a rasterized copy of the KCB facility
letter with a **0-character** text layer):
- digital text layer 0 chars → `ocrNeeded` true → pdf.js rasterized → Tesseract
  returned **1,581 characters** of accurate contract text → `textSource:
  'ocr-local'`, `pages: 1`, progress events fired per page;
- metadata extraction then ran over that text and the provenance line, viewer
  banner and review-panel notice all rendered;
- `capConfidenceForOcr()` verified explicitly: `high → medium`, `medium` and
  `low` untouched, `_ocrCapped` set;
- a synthetic 40-page scan with `maxPages: 3` read 3 pages, reported
  `skippedPages: 37`, saved the text, and produced "Pages 4–40 were not read
  (page limit)";
- cancelling mid-document kept the 2 pages already read;
- a digital PDF (`01_Naivas_Supplier_Agreement.pdf`, 1,964 chars) was **not**
  routed to OCR — no regression on the existing path.

The `ocr-ai` tier could not be exercised in the build environment (no Anthropic
key available); its request/response contract, metering and 429 handling were
verified server-side instead. See SUMMARY.md.
