## Run: Ingestion, AI Budget & Templates upgrade

### 1. Word files were accepted, silently produced nothing, and landed as empty shells

**What was broken.** The file picker offered `.doc` and `.docx` in all three
ingestion entry points (single upload, bulk migration, template upload). But
`extractDocText()` only ever handled `text/*` and `pdf`. A Word file was
therefore accepted, produced an empty string, and a contract record was created
anyway — no counterparty, no dates, no text for the AI review, and an audit
entry that said the document had been imported. Silent failure, and the user
only found out later when the register showed a blank row.

**Root cause.** `MIG_ACCEPT` (`js/views/migration.js`), the `accept` attribute on
`#up-file` (`js/views/contract.js`) and on `#ut-file` (`js/views/library.js`) all
advertised Word support that the extraction path never had. Nothing checked the
file type before creating the record, and the template upload's failure message
told the user "Word files need conversion first" *after* extraction, which is
the right advice at the wrong time.

**The fix.**
- Added `detectWordBytes()` / `detectWordFile()` in `js/views/contract.js`,
  which sniffs the actual bytes rather than trusting the extension or the MIME
  type: `PK\x03\x04` plus a `word/…` OOXML part name means `.docx`;
  `D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1` (OLE2 compound file) means legacy `.doc`. The byte
  check is what catches drag-and-drop, which bypasses `accept` entirely, and a
  renamed file.
- Refusal happens **before** any contract record, file upload or audit entry is
  created, in all three entry points, with one shared message (`WORD_REFUSAL`):
  *"HaTi can't read Word files yet. Save or print the document as a PDF and
  upload that instead — the PDF is also what you'd want on record as the signed
  version."*
- The bulk migration queue shows a distinct `word` row status ("Word — not
  read"), not a generic `error`, and the batch summary counts refusals
  separately.
- Removed `.doc,.docx` from every `accept` attribute so the picker no longer
  invites the file in, and updated the surrounding copy in all three places.

**Files touched.** `js/views/contract.js`, `js/views/migration.js`,
`js/views/library.js`, `js/core.js` (new `EXTRACT_MAX_CHARS` export).

**How it was verified.** Byte-signature detection unit-checked against a
generated `.docx` (real ZIP with `word/document.xml`), a renamed `.docx`
(extension `.pdf`), a legacy OLE2 `.doc` header, and the five bundled
`sample-contracts/*.pdf` files (all correctly *not* flagged). Confirmed no
contract record, no `files` POST and no audit entry is produced on refusal.
